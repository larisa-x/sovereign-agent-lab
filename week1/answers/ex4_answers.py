I changed The Albanach's status to full in mcp_venue_server.py and ran the script again. In Query 1, the search now returned only one venue (The
Haymarket Vaults) instead of two. The Albanach just disappeared from the results. The interesting part is that I didn't touch the agent code or the
exercise script at all - only the data file behind the MCP server. The agent automatically got different results because it asks the server each time it
runs. This showed me how MCP keeps the data separate from the agent logic.

MCP_VALUE_PROPOSITION = """
I think the biggest thing MCP gives you is that tools are discovered at runtime — the agent asks the server what tools are available instead of
having them hardcoded. So you can add or remove tools without changing agent code. Also multiple agents can connect to the same server, which means the
LangGraph research agent and the Rasa confirmation agent can both use the same venue data without copy-pasting code. And when data changes (like a
venue becoming full) every connected agent sees it immediately. That seems really important for the PyNanoClaw hybrid system where two different agents
need to share the same information.

# ── PyNanoClaw architecture — SPECULATION QUESTION ─────────────────────────
#
# (The variable below is still called WEEK_5_ARCHITECTURE because the
# grader reads that exact name. Don't rename it — but read the updated
# prompt: the question is now about PyNanoClaw, the hybrid system the
# final assignment will have you build.)
#
# This is a forward-looking, speculative question. You have NOT yet seen
# the material that covers the planner/executor split, memory, or the
# handoff bridge in detail — that is what the final assignment (releases
# 2026-04-18) is for. The point of asking it here is to check that you
# have read PROGRESS.md and can imagine how the Week 1 pieces grow into
# PyNanoClaw.
#
# Read PROGRESS.md in the repo root. Then write at least 5 bullet points
# describing PyNanoClaw as you imagine it at final-assignment scale.
#
# Each bullet should:
#   - Name a component (e.g. "Planner", "Memory store", "Handoff bridge",
#     "Rasa MCP gateway")
#   - Say in one clause what that component does and which half of
#     PyNanoClaw it lives in (the autonomous loop, the structured agent,
#     or the shared layer between them)
#
# You are not being graded on getting the "right" architecture — there
# isn't one right answer. You are being graded on whether your description
# is coherent and whether you have thought about which Week 1 file becomes
# which PyNanoClaw component.
#
# Example of the level of detail we want:
#   - The Planner is a strong-reasoning model (e.g. Nemotron-3-Super or
#     Qwen3-Next-Thinking) that takes the raw task and produces an ordered
#     list of subgoals. It lives upstream of the ReAct loop in the
#     autonomous-loop half of PyNanoClaw, so the Executor never sees an
#     ambiguous task.
